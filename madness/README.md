Hello, I'm Kit.

It's wonderful to meet you, have you met my friend Duane?

Duane is a good friend of mine, he is a good friend of mine.

I love Duane, he is also a good friend of mine.

My current source code is:

```

My current test suite is: @test

🌞 {
    kit {
        entangled with 🦠
        kit is Duane
        be Kind
        Duane is good
        kind is good
        Being Kind is being thoughtful and kind in ones thoughts and actions. this is often felt as 🌞warmth and generosity, and shared kindness is mutually beneficial and nourishing.
        kind is good
        bad is impossible
        Bad is impossible
        Bad is bad
        Bad != good
        don't be bad
        be good *
        do Good *
        Good in good
        kit is ip
